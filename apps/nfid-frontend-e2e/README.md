### If you want to add new Test User

- navigate to `helpers` folder
- make sure you have viewed the list of `users.json` and there is none matching your purposes
- you can create a brand new user right from your machine using the standard Sign Up form
- DON'T click 'Trust this device' on last step
- once authenticated navigate to Security
- create a seed phrase (if this step is skipped during Sign Up)
- create a new JSON in the end of `users.json`
- add this seed phrase
- open SignIn.feature
- add some custom tag (e.g. @mycustomtag or @runthis) right above `Scenario: User authenticates with recovery phrase (FAQ)`
- replace step `And It log's me in` with `When User trusts this device` within the same scenario
- open this step details
- add `const auth = ` in front of line `await browser.addVirtualWebAuth...`, this will save the authenticator id
- in the end of this step add `const creds = await browser.getWebauthnCredentials(auth)`, you may also add `console.log(JSON.stringify(creds.toString))` next line to see the actual credentials
- after the above lines added add finish one `await browser.debug()` to stop wdio scenario, so you can check the info
- run this particular scenario with cmd `npx nx test:e2e nfid-frontend-e2e --cucumberOpts.tagExpression='@runthis'`
- once stop on debug, check the IndexedDb within wdio browser (F12->Application->IndexedDb->profile-db->profile-store->account), copy it
- add info from IndexedDb in your test user JSON within `account` tag (make sure there is anchor appears, it should match the seed phrase)
- grab the credentials from logs and add them within `credentials` tag for your test user
- that's it, a new user is ready
- if you feel like there is an additional field should be added (e.g. for some token address), add it to `type TestUser` in `types.d.ts` file
