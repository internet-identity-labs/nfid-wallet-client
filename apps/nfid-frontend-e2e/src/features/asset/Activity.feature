  As a user, I want to see assets transaction history

  @activity1
  Scenario Outline: User should be able to see transaction history
    Given User opens NFID site
    And User is already authenticated by <anchor> anchor
    And I press on Activity icon
    Then I should see filter button in Activity tab
    Then I should see <txs> activities in the table
    And I should see transaction <action> <network> <currency> <type> <asset> <timestamp> <from> <to>
    Examples:
      | anchor | txs | action   | type | asset | currency | network           | timestamp     | from                                                             | to                                                               |
