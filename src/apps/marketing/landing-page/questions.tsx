        traditional credential-based logins.

    title: "How is this different than my  current cryptocurrency wallet?",
    info: (
      <div>
        There are four major questions to ask about wallets:
        <ul className="mt-1 mb-4">
          <li>How much privacy do they provide?</li>
          <li>How secure are they from breaches?</li>
          <li>How exactly is this my "identity"?</li>
          <li>How convenient are they to use?</li>
        </ul>
        <div className="mb-3">
          <strong>Privacy</strong>
          <p className="mt-2">
            When you sign in to applications with your current wallet, you're
            essentially introducing yourself to that application with your bank
            account number. The more applications you do this with and the more
            transacion history you create, the more you incentivize attackers to
            find your real-life identity. NFID actually generates a new
            hybrid-hardware wallet for every account you create on every website
            and application that can only be linked to each other by you, the
            owner of those accounts.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="mb-3">
          <strong>Security</strong>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Proving ownership of a private key is the most secure means of
            authentication, and every wallet now has some way of storing them.
            There is a difference in how they're stored, which has more to do
            with convenience, but ultimately the best private key storage is the
            kind that makes exporting from the device impossible. Some wallets
            offer that (NFID being one of them), though most don't. What's not
            been discussed often enough is how vulnerable the interface is
            between you and you private key. If that interface is hosted on
            centralized Web2 architecture like AWS or Apple/Google, it's an
            attack vector since governments, the company itself, or individual
            attackers all have ways of gaining access or even deactivating the
            interface. All wallets today have interfaces served from centralized
            architecture except NFID, which is served from the Internet
            Computer.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="mb-3">
          <strong>Identity</strong>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Authenticating yourself to applications on the internet should keep
            you anonymous and protected from impersonation by default, but you
            should also be able to prove you are a unique human being. For
            example if you're creating an account with a regulated entity like a
            bank, you'll need to complete KYC/AML procedures. If you're
            registering with a DAO, the process should protect against voting
            manipulation or resource extraction. Some wallets take an approach
            of requiring pre-authorization (i.e. KYC), others require
            registering a photo or video of yourself for community approval, and
            some rely on other services to issue your wallet a credential
            attesting you are a unique human (further risking exposure of your
            identity since it's issued to the same wallet identifier). NFID
            takes the approach that there will be many services attesting many
            different things about you. Every application you sign in with NFID
            can issue that specific identifier a credential that can be used
            across applications without revealing the identifier it was issued
            to. Strong privacy. Strong security. Flexible identity credentialing
            capabilities.

        </div>
        <div className="mb-3">
          <strong>Convenience</strong>
          <p className="mt-2">
            The best experience of creating accounts with other services is the
            one that requires zero effort. Today's wallets all experience the
            same inconveniences because they require authentication from a
            specific device that an app was downloaded to. One-touch across any
            of your desktops, tablets, and phones is all that's required for
            private and secure multi-factor authentication to any website or
            application. No download required.
