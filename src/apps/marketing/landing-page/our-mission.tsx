                          freedom to speak our minds, and freedom from targeted
                          manipulation, all with the security and simplicity of
                          the native face or fingerprint scan of our personal
                          devices. We see a future where we can’t be subject to
                          targeted manipulation because our activity can’t be
                          tracked across accounts, where we can speak our minds
                          because creating an account reveals no personal
                          information about ourselves, and where we can move our
                          digital assets without revealing who we are or the
                          accounts in which our assets were stored.
